# Juego de la Rana
<!-- 3D Augmented Reality version of the Basque Juego de la Rana -->
The Basque "Juego de la Rana" is a popular street game in Bilbao where one must attempt to throw a coin into the mouth of a brass frog statue. 
Its a little bit like cornhole in the US, except, nearly impossible; we probably see about one coin go in for every 1000 tosses.

Recently, as the yearly festival of Aste Nagusia was wrapping up, we came across a La Rana setup with barely anyone else around (a rarity, the board in Casco Viejo is usually surrounded by dozens). 
I took the opportunity to do my photogrammetry thing, and oh man did it turn out just about perfect.

Now I'm inspired to create an AR version of the game, just so I can sit in my living room and flick a thousand coins at a brass frog without waking the neighbors.
